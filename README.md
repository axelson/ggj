This is our entry to the [Global Game Jam 2012](http://globalgamejam.org/). It is a game about a boy who is stuck in a land of snakes and
must escape his cycle of death by tricking the snake into eating itself.

We plan to use [Cocos2D-javascript](http://cocos2d-javascript.org/) as the HTML5 game engine.

The main developers are [@axelson](https://github.com/axelson), [@keokilee](https://github.com/keokilee), and [@yongwen](https://github.com/yongwen)
